    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive dashboard to transform the static report into a dynamic BDR tool. The structure includes: 1) Top-level summary cards for an immediate overview of the landscape (total companies, customers, partners, vendors). 2) A visual breakdown via a donut chart for quick proportional analysis. 3) Core interactive controls (search and category filters) to allow the user to instantly find specific companies or view specific segments. 4) A responsive card grid to display companies, providing key info at a glance. 5) A modal popup for detailed analysis, which keeps the main interface clean by showing details only on demand. This task-oriented design directly supports the BDR's workflow of enriching company data by making information retrieval and categorization fast and intuitive. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Aggregate counts of each category -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Method: Dynamic statistic cards (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: None -> Justification: Provides a quick, scannable summary of the entire dataset.
        - Report Info: Proportional breakdown of categories -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Method: Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Offers an immediate visual understanding of the market composition, which is more impactful than text alone.
        - Report Info: Full company list -> Goal: Organize/Explore -> Viz/Method: Interactive Card Grid (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Click to view details, filterable, searchable -> Justification: Transforms the static list into a searchable, filterable database, which is the core functional requirement for the BDR.
        - Report Info: Detailed analysis for each company -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Method: Modal Popup (HTML/Tailwind/JS) -> Interaction: Click to open/close -> Justification: Hides lengthy text to prevent clutter, presenting deep-dive information only when requested by the user.
